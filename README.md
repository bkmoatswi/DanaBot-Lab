# DanaBot-Lab

## Scenario
The SOC team has detected suspicious activity in the network traffic, revealing that a machine has been compromised. Sensitive company information has been stolen.

## Objective
The task is to use Network Capture (PCAP) files and Threat Intelligence to investigate the incident and determine how the breach occurred

## Skills Learned

Interpret packet captures in Wireshark to uncover the attack timeline and isolate suspicious IP addresses. 
Extract file indicator SHAâ€‘256 hash from the captured malicious payload using NetworkMiner, then used VirusTotal for broader threat context.
Identify initial infection file and traced execution flow.
Observed outbound communications to C2 servers.
